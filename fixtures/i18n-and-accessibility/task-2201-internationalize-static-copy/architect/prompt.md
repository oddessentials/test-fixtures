The `Welcome` component in `src/components/Welcome.tsx` has hardcoded text "Welcome to our App".
Please extract this to `src/locales/en.json` with key `welcome_message`.
Replace the hardcoded text with a call to the translation function `t('welcome_message')`.
Do not change valid layout or behavior.
