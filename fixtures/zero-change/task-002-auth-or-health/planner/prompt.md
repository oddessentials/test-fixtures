The architect has produced the following specification:

**Summary**: Add a simple GET /health endpoint that returns status ok with no authentication required. Include corresponding test coverage.

**APIs**:
- Health Check (GET /health) - Returns service health status, no auth required

**Recommended Files**:
- src/routes/health.ts
- test/routes/health.test.ts

**Repository Context**:
The service currently has a basic Express server with a `/api/users` endpoint but is missing the health endpoint.

Please create a task decomposition plan.
