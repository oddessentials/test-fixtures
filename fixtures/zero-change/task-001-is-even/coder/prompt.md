You are the coder agent. Apply the architect and planner guidance to fix the
`isEven(n: number): boolean` function.

Requirements:

- Correct the implementation in `src/utils/isEven.ts` so that:
  - `isEven(2)`, `isEven(0)`, `isEven(-4)` are `true`
  - `isEven(1)`, `isEven(-3)` are `false`
- Do **not** touch any other files.
- Keep the change as small and focused as possible.

Return a single unified diff patch that updates `src/utils/isEven.ts` only.
