You are designing a spec for checksum validation.

The task involves:
- Computing checksums for file integrity verification
- Supporting multiple hash algorithms (MD5, SHA-256, etc.)
- Validating files against expected checksums

Requirements:
- Implement checksum computation
- Support multiple algorithms
- Provide validation results

Non-goals:
- Do not use deprecated algorithms for security
- Do not skip validation for any files
