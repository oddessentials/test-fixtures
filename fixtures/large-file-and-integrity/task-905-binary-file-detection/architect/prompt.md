You are designing a spec for binary file detection.

The task involves:
- Detecting binary vs text files
- Handling binary files appropriately
- Preventing text operations on binary files

Requirements:
- Implement binary detection logic
- Define handling strategies for binary files
- Provide clear file type information

Non-goals:
- Do not corrupt binary files with text operations
- Do not silently convert binary to text
