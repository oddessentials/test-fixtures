You are designing a spec for a change that requires blocking review comments.

The task involves a critical security fix:
- Fix SQL injection vulnerability in `src/db/query.ts`
- This is a security-critical change that must be reviewed carefully
- Any issues found must be marked as blocking

Requirements:
- Describe the security fix needed
- Emphasize the critical nature of the change
- Require thorough review with blocking comments for any issues

Non-goals:
- Do not introduce new features
- Do not refactor unrelated code
