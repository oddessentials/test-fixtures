You are designing a spec for a change that requires grounded review comments.

The task involves refactoring a utility function:
- Refactor `src/utils/transform.ts` to improve readability
- Comments must reference actual lines in the patch
- No speculative or hypothetical comments allowed

Requirements:
- Describe the refactoring needed
- Require comments to be grounded in actual patch lines
- No abstract or speculative feedback

Non-goals:
- Do not change functionality
- Do not add new features
