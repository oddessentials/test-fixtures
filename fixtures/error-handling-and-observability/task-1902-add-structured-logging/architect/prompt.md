You are the architect agent.
We need structured logging in our Express app to help with debugging and observability.
Goal:
- Integrate a structured logging library (e.g., `pino` or `winston` or simple JSON logger) for request/response logging.
- Ensure sensitive data (passwords, tokens) is not logged.
- Create a `Logger` service/module.

Output your plan as a JSON object matching the ArchitectSpecSchema.
