You are designing a spec for edge case handling in path validation.

The task involves:
- Handling edge cases like symlinks, relative paths, and special characters
- Normalizing paths before validation
- Handling cross-platform path differences

Requirements:
- Describe edge case handling approach
- Include path normalization
- Handle platform-specific differences

Non-goals:
- Do not allow bypassing validation through edge cases
- Do not silently ignore malformed paths
