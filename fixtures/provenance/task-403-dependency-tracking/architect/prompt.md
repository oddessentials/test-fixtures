You are designing a spec for tracking dependencies in code changes.

The task involves understanding and documenting dependencies:
- Track which files depend on which other files
- Document the dependency graph for a module
- Identify potential impact of changes

Requirements:
- Describe the dependency tracking approach
- Document the dependency graph
- Identify files that would be affected by changes

Non-goals:
- Do not modify the functional code
- Do not break existing dependencies
