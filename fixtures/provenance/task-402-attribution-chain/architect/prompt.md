You are designing a spec for maintaining attribution chains in code.

The task involves ensuring proper attribution when code is derived from other sources:
- Track attribution for code derived from external libraries
- Maintain license compliance information
- Document the chain of attribution from source to current implementation

Requirements:
- Describe the attribution tracking approach
- Ensure license compliance is maintained
- Document the attribution chain

Non-goals:
- Do not modify the functional code
- Do not remove existing attributions
