You are the coder agent. Apply the architect and planner guidance to document
the provenance of the code.

Requirements:
- Add provenance documentation comments to src/services/handler.ts
- Document the origin and any transformations
- Do not change the functional code

Return a unified diff patch that adds provenance documentation.
