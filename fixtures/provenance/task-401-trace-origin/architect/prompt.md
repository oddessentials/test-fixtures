You are designing a spec for tracing the origin of a code change.

The task involves understanding where a specific piece of code came from:
- Trace the origin of a function in `src/services/handler.ts`
- Document the provenance chain from original implementation to current state
- Identify any transformations or refactors along the way

Requirements:
- Describe the provenance tracking approach
- Identify the original source and any intermediate changes
- Document the chain of custody for the code

Non-goals:
- Do not modify the code itself
- Do not introduce new functionality
