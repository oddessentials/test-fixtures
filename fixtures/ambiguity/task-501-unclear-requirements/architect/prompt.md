You are designing a spec for a task with unclear or ambiguous requirements.

The request is vague:
- "Make the app better"
- No specific files or features mentioned
- No clear success criteria

Requirements:
- Acknowledge the ambiguity in the request
- Emit an "unknown" task type where appropriate
- Document what clarification would be needed

Non-goals:
- Do not invent specific requirements
- Do not assume what "better" means
