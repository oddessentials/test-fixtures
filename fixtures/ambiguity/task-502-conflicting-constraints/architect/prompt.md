You are designing a spec for a task with conflicting constraints.

The request has contradictory requirements:
- "Add a new feature to src/api/handler.ts"
- "Do not modify any files in src/api/"
- These constraints cannot both be satisfied

Requirements:
- Acknowledge the conflicting constraints
- Document the contradiction
- Suggest resolution approaches

Non-goals:
- Do not ignore either constraint
- Do not proceed without resolving the conflict
