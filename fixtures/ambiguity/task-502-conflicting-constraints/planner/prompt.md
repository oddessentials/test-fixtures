Using the architect's spec for conflicting constraints, produce a task list
that acknowledges the contradiction.

Conflicting requirements:
- Add a feature to src/api/handler.ts
- Do not modify any files in src/api/

Requirements:
- Emit "unknown" task type for the conflicting area
- Document the conflict in ambiguities
