You are designing a spec for extracting shared code into a new module.

The task involves:
- Extract common validation logic from multiple files
- Create a new shared module `src/utils/validation.ts`
- Update all files to import from the new shared module

Requirements:
- Describe the extraction operation
- List all files that need to be updated
- Ensure the shared module is properly structured

Non-goals:
- Do not change validation logic
- Do not add new validation rules
