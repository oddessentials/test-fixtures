You are designing a spec for moving a file and updating all imports.

The task involves:
- Move `src/helpers/utils.ts` to `src/utils/helpers.ts`
- Update all import paths across the codebase
- Ensure no broken imports remain

Requirements:
- Describe the file move operation
- List all files that need import updates
- Ensure consistency across all imports

Non-goals:
- Do not change file contents
- Do not add new functionality
