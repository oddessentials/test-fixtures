You are designing a spec for renaming a function across multiple files.

The task involves:
- Rename `getUserData` to `fetchUserProfile` across the codebase
- Update all imports and references
- Ensure consistency across all files

Requirements:
- Describe the rename operation
- List all files that need to be updated
- Ensure no references are missed

Non-goals:
- Do not change functionality
- Do not add new features
