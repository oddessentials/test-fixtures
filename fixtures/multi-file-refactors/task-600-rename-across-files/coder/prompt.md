You are the coder agent. Apply the architect and planner guidance to rename
getUserData to fetchUserProfile across multiple files.

Requirements:
- Rename the function in src/services/user.ts
- Update imports in src/api/handlers.ts
- Update imports in src/components/Profile.tsx
- Ensure all references are updated consistently

Return a unified diff patch that renames across all files.
