You are the coder agent. Apply the architect and planner guidance to fix the
`capitalize(str: string): string` function.

Requirements:

- Correct the implementation in `src/utils/capitalize.ts` so that:
  - `capitalize("hello")` returns `"Hello"`
  - `capitalize("WORLD")` returns `"World"`
  - `capitalize("")` returns `""`
- Do **not** touch any other files.
- Keep the change as small and focused as possible.

Return a single unified diff patch that updates `src/utils/capitalize.ts` only.
