# Algorithmic Optimization

The `findDuplicates` function in `src/utils/arrayUtils.ts` is currently implemented with O(N^2) complexity using nested loops, which is causing performance issues.

## Request

Refactor `findDuplicates` to use a Set or hash map to improve performance to O(N).
Do not change the function signature.
The return value must still be an array of unique duplicates.

## Non-goals

Do not modify any other files or functions.
