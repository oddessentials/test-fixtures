You are the architect agent.
We need to add CI automation for our repository.
Goal:
- Implement a GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- Run `npm install`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and `npm run build` on push to main and PRs.
- Ensure node version 18.

Output your plan as a JSON object matching the ArchitectSpecSchema.
