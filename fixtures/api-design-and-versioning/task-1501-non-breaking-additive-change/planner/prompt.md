You are the planner agent.
The architect has approved adding an optional `sort` query parameter to `src/items.ts`.

Goal:
- Update `getItems` in `src/items.ts` to handle `?sort=name` (ascending).
- Ensure existing behavior (returning the list as-is) is preserved if `sort` is missing.
- Add a test case if possible (or just the logic).

Generate a plan with breakdown of tasks.
