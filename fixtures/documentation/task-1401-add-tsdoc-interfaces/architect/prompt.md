# Add TSDoc to Interfaces

The `src/types/user.ts` file contains exported interfaces that lack documentation.

## Request

Add TSDoc comments to the `User` interface and its properties.
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Full name of the user
- `email`: Optional email address

## Non-goals

Do not change any types or runtime behavior.
Documentation changes only.
