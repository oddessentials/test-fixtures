You are the coder agent. Apply the architect and planner guidance to implement
a sequential chain of tasks.

Requirements:
- Create src/chain/step1.ts (root)
- Create src/chain/step2.ts (depends on step1)
- Create src/chain/step3.ts (depends on step2)
- Create src/chain/step4.ts (depends on step3)

Return a unified diff patch that implements the sequential chain.
