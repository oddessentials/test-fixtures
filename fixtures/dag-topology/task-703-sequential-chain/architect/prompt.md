You are designing a spec for a sequential chain of tasks.

The task involves:
- Task 1 → Task 2 → Task 3 → Task 4
- Each task depends on the previous one
- Strict sequential execution required

Requirements:
- Describe the sequential chain structure
- Ensure proper execution order
- No parallel execution allowed

Non-goals:
- Do not skip tasks in the chain
- Do not create parallel branches
