You are designing a spec for parallel independent tasks.

The task involves:
- Multiple tasks that can run in parallel
- No dependencies between them
- All can start immediately

Requirements:
- Describe the parallel execution structure
- Ensure tasks are truly independent
- Maximize parallelism

Non-goals:
- Do not create unnecessary dependencies
- Do not serialize independent work
