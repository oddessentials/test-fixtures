You are the coder agent. Apply the architect and planner guidance to implement
parallel independent tasks.

Requirements:
- Create src/parallel/taskX.ts (independent)
- Create src/parallel/taskY.ts (independent)
- Create src/parallel/taskZ.ts (independent)
- No dependencies between tasks

Return a unified diff patch that implements the parallel tasks.
