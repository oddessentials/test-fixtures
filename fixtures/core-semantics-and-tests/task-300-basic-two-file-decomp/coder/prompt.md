You are the coder agent. Apply the architect and planner guidance to implement
the string formatting utility with proper decomposition.

Requirements:
- Create the utility function in src/utils/format.ts
- Update main code in src/main.ts to use the utility
- Add tests in test/format.test.ts
- Ensure all affected parts are updated consistently

Return a unified diff patch that implements the decomposed changes.
