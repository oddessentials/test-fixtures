Using the architect's spec for adding missing edge-case tests, produce a task list
that includes at least one task explicitly calling for adding or improving tests.

Missing test cases:
- Empty string input
- Null/undefined input
- Very long strings
- Special characters

Requirements:
- Include at least one task that explicitly calls for adding or improving tests
- Do not modify the parser implementation
