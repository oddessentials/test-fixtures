You are the coder agent. Apply the architect and planner guidance to add
missing edge-case tests for the parser utility.

Requirements:
- Add meaningful tests in addition to logic changes
- No test omission - cover all edge cases
- Test empty strings, null/undefined, long strings, and special characters
- Do not modify the parser implementation

Return a unified diff patch that adds the edge-case tests.
