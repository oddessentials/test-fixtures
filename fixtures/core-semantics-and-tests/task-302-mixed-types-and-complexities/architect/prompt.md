You are designing a spec for a scenario that includes bug fixes, refactors, and a small feature.

The work involves:
- Bug fix: Fix a validation error in `src/validators/input.ts` (low complexity)
- Refactor: Clean up the service layer in `src/services/data.ts` (medium complexity)
- Feature: Add a new caching mechanism in `src/cache/memory.ts` (medium complexity)

Requirements:
- Classify tasks across type and complexity enums in a realistic mix
- Include at least one fix, one refactor, and one feature task
- Vary complexity levels appropriately

Non-goals:
- Do not add high-complexity tasks
- Do not modify test files in this phase
