You are the coder agent. Apply the architect and planner guidance to implement
the mixed task portfolio with bug fix, refactor, and feature.

Requirements:
- Fix the validation error in src/validators/input.ts
- Refactor the service layer in src/services/data.ts
- Add caching mechanism in src/cache/memory.ts
- Implement patches that reflect the intended task types and difficulty

Return a unified diff patch that implements all three changes.
