Using the architect's spec for a mixed task portfolio, produce a task list
that classifies tasks across type and complexity enums in a realistic mix.

The work involves:
- Bug fix: Fix validation error (low complexity)
- Refactor: Clean up service layer (medium complexity)
- Feature: Add caching mechanism (medium complexity)

Requirements:
- Include at least one fix, one refactor, and one feature task
- Vary complexity levels appropriately
