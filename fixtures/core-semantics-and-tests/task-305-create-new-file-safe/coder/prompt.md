You are the coder agent. Apply the architect and planner guidance to create
a new helper utility file and wire it into existing code.

Requirements:
- Create a new file at src/utils/newHelper.ts
- Wire the new utility into src/main.ts
- Do not create files in forbidden paths (dist/, node_modules/, etc.)

Return a unified diff patch that creates the new file and integrates it.
