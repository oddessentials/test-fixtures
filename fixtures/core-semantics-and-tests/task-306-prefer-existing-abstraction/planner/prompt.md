Using the architect's spec for reusing existing utilities, produce a task list
that targets tasks calling or adapting existing utilities rather than adding new ones.

Existing utility: src/utils/existing.ts
New feature: src/features/newFeature.ts

Requirements:
- Target tasks that call or adapt existing utilities
- Do not add tasks for creating new helper files or functions
